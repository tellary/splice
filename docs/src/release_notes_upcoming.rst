.. release-notes:: Upcoming

  - Deployment

      - The ``migration.id`` value is no longer required by the SV (sv, validator, scan apps) and validator (validator app) helm charts and has been removed.
        These apps now resolve the synchronizer migration id automatically at start-up. For the scan helm chart the
        ``migration.id`` value is now optional and only needs to be set to bootstrap a scan that does not yet have any
        migration id in its database (e.g. the network-founding or a freshly joining scan).

      - SV

          - The ``migration.id`` value was removed from the SV helm charts (sv, validator, scan apps).
            These apps now resolve the synchronizer migration id automatically at start-up from their database.
            A freshly joining scan that does not yet have any migration id in its database bootstraps it from the
            scan of the SV sponsoring the onboarding, configured via the new optional ``sponsorScanUrl`` value in the
            scan helm chart.

      - Validator

          - The ``migration.id`` value was removed from the validator (validator app) helm chart and is no longer
            supported for docker-compose deployments. The validator now resolves the synchronizer migration id
            automatically at start-up from its database. The value must be removed from both the helm chart and
            the docker-compose configuration.

      .. Important::

          The migration id must still be kept for participant database naming for backwards compatibility (``persistance.databaseName`` helm value,
          ``CANTON_PARTICIPANT_POSTGRES_DB`` docker compose env variable) to ensure the participant uses the currently configured database.

  - Scan

    - The following deprecated endpoints have been removed from the public API:

        - ``/v0/activities``
