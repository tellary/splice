  - Deployment

      - Helm Charts

          - All Helm charts now support overriding full image names.
            It is possible to override the default image names using new Helm values.
            This change helps deployments that require specific naming conventions for images.

    - Token Standard V2 (CIP-112)

      - Notable callouts for Amulet changes:
          - add support for single-step transfers via the V2 transfer factory interface for
            cases where both sender and receiver authorization is available
          - add a ``meta : Optional Metadata`` field to the ``AmuletRules.TransferOutput`` type and
            the ``TransferPreapproval_SendV2`` choice
          - properly classify the burn of ANS in the V2 token standard transaction history
          - change ``V1.AllocationFactory_Allocate`` to enforce that ```settlement.allocateBefore``
            is strictly before ``settlement.settleBefore``
          - introduce ``AmuletConfig.tokenStandardMaxTTL`` config parameter
            with a default value of 90 days
          - limit the maximum life-time of transfer instructions to ``tokenStandardMaxTTL``
            to prevent excessively long-lived transfer instructions
          - allow the DSO to expire both V1 and V2 amulet allocations older than
            ``tokenStandardMaxTTL``, even if the settlement deadline has not yet passed
          - support creating Amulet allocations for burn


      - Add preview of the V2 token standard APIs and implement them for Amulet

      - Add support for creating Allocations V2 of Amulet in the Splice Amulet Wallet UI.
        This is meant for users that create the allocations for an allocation request
        using the registry specific UIs for each asset. The Amulet Wallet UI
        therefore does not archive the V2 AllocationRequest when creating the
        Amulet Allocation for it, so that the allocation request is visible in the other
        registry UIs as well.

        For creating all allocations in a single transaction `as documented in CIP-112 <https://github.com/canton-foundation/cips/blob/main/cip-0112/cip-0112.md#423-traders-accept-allocation-requests-and-create-allocations>`__, we recommend using
        a token standard v2 wallet UI that uniformly supports all V1 and V2 assets.

      - The dar ``splice-api-token-transfer-events-v2`` and its dependencies (namely, Token Standard V2 dars) are now uploaded by default on all validator nodes.

      .. TODO(#4707): add callouts for wallets, explorers, SVs, validator operators, app operators as needed
      .. TODO(#4707): add Daml versions of token standard to release notes
